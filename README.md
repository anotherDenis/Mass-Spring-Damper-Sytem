# Mass-Spring-Damper-Sytem
This is a project to design an adjustable controller to observe various behaviours which exist in mass-spring-damper systems. The output will rely on an appropriate sensor to track the position and measure the speed of the mass. The output will feed back into the system to adjust the controller to correct the desired outcome.
